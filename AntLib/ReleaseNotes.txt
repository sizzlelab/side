ANT Radio Library - Release Notes
v2.1
2011-04-04

=============================================================
1. USAGE

These library files should be used by any ANT Radio applications as the interface to ANT devices. 

Applications communicate with the ANT chip using the functions defined in com.dsi.ant.AntInterface (after calling getInstance() to retrieve the singleton instance).  Constant definitions are in com.dsi.ant.AntMesg and AntDefine.

Also note that only one ANT application is currently supported at a time, so you will need to claim the interface before any requests will succeed and listen for the ANT_INTERFACE_CLAIMED_ACTION intent to know if another application has taken control (through request force claim) of the ANT radio.
