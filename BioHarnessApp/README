SIDE are tools for researchers to collect external to mobile phone sensors data for Android platform. SIDE includes both Android client and server-side back-end.

----------------------------------------
This repository hosts following Android components:

* ANTLib -- library project released by ANT alliance to work with ANT+ interface.
* AcelerometerApp -- Accelerometer driver application
* AntPulseApp -- Ant+ heart rate driver application
* HxM -- Zephyr HxM heart beat sensor driver
* ThermoApp -- Fora IR21 thermometer driver
* ManagerApp -- Generic application capable of collecting data from sensors through driver application interfaces
* PhysicalActivity -- library code for stand-alone appications PhysicalActivityBt & PhysicalActivityAnt reusing drivers code to connect to sensors. As Ant+ plus version is dependent on library which has to be preinstalled on the device, this is the easiest way to reuse code in both applications.
* PhysicalActivityBt -- application using Bluetooth based Zephyr HxM heart rate driver.
* PhysicalActivityAnt -- application using Ant+ library to connect to Ant+ capable heart rate meters.

* Platform -- library used by all applications and drivers

----------------------------------------
This repository hosts following backend components:
* ServerSide -- Custom Drupal 6 modules to support SIDE portal
    -SIDE -- Data modles for SIDE
    -SIDE_research_project -- Research project node modle
    -SIDEws -- SIDE RESTFul API
